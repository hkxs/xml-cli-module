# XmlCli-Module

This project is a fork from [UFFAF (UEFI Firmware Foundational Automation
Framework)](https://github.com/intel/xml-cli) tool from Intel(R) (formerly
XmlCli), unfortunately, the original project seems to be intended as a
standalone tool rather than a Python module, this project aims to update the
tool to make it easier to work with on any other Python project.

This module is intended to be used to read BIOS knobs and system information
with an easy-to-use API.


## Pre-Requisites
This module requires XmlCli BIOS driver enabled
